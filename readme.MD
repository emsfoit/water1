# Ahla Chai

Inspiration
Ahlai Chai means a beautiful tea, which is a term of simple water quality test that can be shown from the smell, color and teste of cup of tea.

The are two main goals in our application. Firstly, the application is a knowledge base for the Gaza people, with information for consumers, vendors and suppliers regarding water treatment techniques, mythbusting and the basis for an online certification corse.
Secondly, it serves as a listing of water trucks, and desalination plants within Gaza. Water trucks who have taken the time to register, perform regular testing, and provide a great servce are promoted on a 'Best in your area' list. the list also provides the driver's locations, along with options to search for closest water truckers, and view all trucks and desalination plants.
We created a web application along with a native mobile app. For the web app, we worked in html and vanialla javascript, making use of the bootstrap css framework. Mapping features were powered by the HERE map api.
Our nartive mobile app was created in React native, with the intention to provide robust, offline functionaliy going forward.

Our group have a diverse mix of specialties, so making sure everyone could contribute with the techs/languages they are most comfortable with.

We also only had a single merge conflict the whole day, amazing!

What's next for Ahla Chai
Optimization, possibly making use of a faster front end framework . database intergration. online payments platform. real time location tracking.
